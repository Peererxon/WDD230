      <h1>Discover Barquisimeto</h1>

      <div class="discover-information">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The history of Barquisimeto as a city begins in 1552 when the Segovian officer Juan de Villegas was in El
          Tocuyo, the first city founded in western Venezuela, the center of operations from where the process of the
          conquest began.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1556, the town began to be built again, this time in a place called El Carabalí. This time under the name
          of
          Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto. When the small city began to solidify, it was turned into ashes by the tyrant
          Lope de Aguirre in 1561. This action caused the small city to change its settlement for the third time. On
          that
          occasion Nueva Segovia managed to settle in the place known as "Desembocadero de Barquisimeto" where the
          Turbio
          and Claro rivers converge. Unfortunately, it suffered heavy flooding due to the instability of the chosen
          site,
          so it moved again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, and for the fourth time, Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto changed location in 1563, occupying the high
          plateau where it is currently located, eleven years after Juan de Villegas founded Nueva Segovia de Buría. It
          is
          from this settlement that the city truly began to develop, whose most outstanding characteristics were the
          mathematical symmetry with which it was built in an advanced population in terms of its colonial aspect, whose
          development from that very moment was uninterrupted and growing, finding us with the current Barquisimeto.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="discover-information">
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
          Barquisimeto is located on the terrace of the same name, on the banks of the ”Río Turbio”. Barquisimeto is
          located in the center-west of Venezuela (353 kilometers (219 mi) from Caracas, the capital of the country),
          which can be traveled in 4 to 5 hours by car.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="discover-information">
        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>
          Barquisimeto has an estimated population of 1,972,233 inhabitants and a territory of 81,700 square kilometers,
          which represents 8.9% of the national surface and 16.5% of the population.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="discover-information">
        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>
          Barquisimeto's location in the interior of Venezuela, allows it to be a confluence of land routes between the
          central and western regions, with the western plains and the south, with the coastal axis to the north, with
          the Andes to the west and with Zulia to the northwest. In addition, it is located next to a fertile valley,
          which has contributed to agricultural production, the development of commerce, service and manufacturing
          industries, which are the main economic activities of the urban area. Being located on a high plateau, the
          city of Barquisimeto is one of the few Venezuelan cities with a hypodamic urban plan.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a deep stagnation in the nineties, in this decade, there has been a huge rebound in terms of investment
          in construction, industry, commerce and services, which has boosted the growth of this city, which has
          consolidated its position as the fourth largest city in Venezuela. This is why in the last three years,
          numerous shopping malls, hotels for all levels, office buildings, residences and business centers have
          appeared in all its growth poles.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can also highlight the proximity to the twin cities of Acarigua and Araure, the Agroindustrial and Food
          Pole Center of the country, which facilitates trade relations and the development of the city's food activity,
          thus having a great economic growth between the two cities.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this city, urban activities linked to industry, commerce and services stand out, as well as the
          exploitation and transformation of non-metallic minerals and agricultural production, mainly coffee harvested
          in the Rio Claro area.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, it concentrates more than 80 percent of the State's manufacturing establishments, with a strong
          orientation towards food production and the manufacture of foundry and metal mechanical products.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 1983, the largest wholesale market in Venezuela, known as MERCABAR (Mercado Mayorista de Alimentos de
          Barquisimeto or Wholesale Food Market of Barquisimeto), has existed in Barquisimeto's Industrial Zone III,
          with a land area of 108 hectares (42 of
          which are developed), whose main activity is the production of public services for sale and whose income comes
          from this activity. One of its main objectives is to provide, maintain and manage adequate spaces for the
          organization of wholesale trade in its area of influence.
        </p>

      <div class="discover-information">
        <h2>Weather</h2>
        <p>
          In Barquisimeto, the warm climate is dominant although it is attenuated due to its altitude at about 650
          meters (0.40 mi) above sea level, which makes its climate pleasant to what it should normally be. In
          Barquisimeto, summers are short, very hot, muggy, dry and cloudy and winters are short, hot, oppressive, wet
          and mostly cloudy. During the course of the year, the temperature generally varies from 20 °C (68 ºF) to 31 °C
          (87.8 ºF) and rarely drops below 19 °C (66.2 ºF) or rises above 34 °C (93.2 ºF).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="discover-information">
        <h2>Tourism</h2>
        <p>
          On the occasion of its quadricentennial in 1952, the highest obelisk in Venezuela was erected in Barquisimeto,
          from where you can contemplate its famous sunsets, which have made it called the "City of twilight". Apart
          from Barquisimeto, which has cultural and musical activities, museums, temples and theaters, it is worth
          visiting the historic and colonial area of Carora, the relics of El Tocuyo. Quibor with its museums and famous
          handicrafts and archeology; Sanare, a beautiful town nestled in the Andes, where you can also buy beautiful
          handicrafts. We can not fail to recommend a visit to Humocaro, Alto and Bajo, the latter with a beautiful
          Bolivar Square, at the foot of a high mountain and surrounded by beautiful chaguaramos.
