    <h1>Design Principles</h1>

    <main>
        <div id="grid">
            <section class="card">
                <div class="card-header">
                    <h2>Emphasis</h2>
                    <h3>Budgetbakers</h3>
                </div>
                <img src="images/budgetbakers.png" alt="Budgetbakers">
                <a href="https://budgetbakers.com/" target="_blank">Link to: Budgetbakers</a>

                <p>
                    Here we can see how the "Emphasis" design rule is applied, when the users enter to the home of the
                    main page, they can clearly see how Budgerbankers are inviting them to download their mobile
                    application, it
                    should be noted that this page also has a web version but Budgetbakers want to emphasize that the
                    user
                    to download
                    the mobile application.
                </p>

                    <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

                <p>
                    Here we can see how Hick's Law is perfectly applied, only 2 main options are being given
                    to the user, one is to "Apply now" and the other is to "Request more info", by doing this we comply
                    with
                    the
                    Hick's Law and do not distress the user with many options.

                    <h3>Reddit</h3>

                <p>
                    Reddit's website is an example of repetition because it focuses on creating consistency by using the
                    same position in all the elements on its home page. We can see that all posts have the same
                    repeating
                    pattern, a title, a right-aligned photo, the date of publication, the subreddit where the post was
                    published, the likes, the comment counter and the awards. A visual pattern is created for all posts
                    making the user experience more accessible, useful and intuitive.
