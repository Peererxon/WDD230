        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The Seattle Chamber of Commerce will be used to serve both local
          businesses and local customers alike. The Chamber wants to see the
          success of our local economy and we believe that each of these
          community members go hand-in-hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Businesses will seek out the Chamber of Commerce to help them become
          successful in the community. Once a member, they will be able to
          connect and advocate for other local businesses. We believe that the
          businesses will want to join the Chamber for this reason alone.
          Attending events, networking, and keeping the pulse, will benefit them
          in the long run. Businesses looking to join will be serious about
          growth, activity, participation, and building Seattle to be its best!
        </p>

        <p>
          Locals will utilize the Chamber to find businesses to support. Like
          businesses who join, this will be a great opportunity for them to
          network with local businesses and their owners. Locals will also be
          interested in the Chamber because it will help them stay connected to
          the community and to support new and old businesses alike.

          Hello, my name is Steve jobs. I am looking to open an appliance store
          in town. I am nervous; however, because I am from a different city and

          you connect me with local businesses so that I can get to know the
          community? I would also appreciate any help spreading the word about
          my new business. We open in December!
